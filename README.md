This software implements a Hybrid Digital Twin architecture designed for the operational safety of nuclear reactors. The system's objective is to provide early diagnosis of thermohydraulic faults and reactivity anomalies, overcoming the sensitivity limitations of classic protection systems without compromising immunity to false alarms.
